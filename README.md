# Task-7-Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions

OS- linux
Browser- Firefox

Currently have no extensions installed, so i am documenting process and the steps involved.

1. Open your Firefox browser.
2. Click on the three horizontal lines (menu) in the upper right corner.
3. Select "Extensions and themes" from the dropdown menu.

**"No extensions were found in the Add-ons Manager."**
**"No permissions or reviews to check as there are no installed extensions."****
**"No unused or suspicious extensions identified."****
**"No extensions were removed as none were installed."**

In case, any suspicious extension found, remove extension and restart browser for better browser performance.

**My Research Summary** : 
Malicious extensions can track data, inject ads, and slow down performance.
1. Data Theft: Malicious extensions can track our browsering habits and gather our personal data such as passwords, banking details etc. which could be further sold to third party and be used as digital threat.
2. Ad Injection: Malicious extensions can distrub user experience by showcasing unwanted advertisement. These unwanted ads can lead to harmful sites compromising user security. 
3. Harmful websites: Malicious extensions can take user to unsecured websites leading to installation of software without user consent, which may steal user personal information or may install malware on user's device.
4. Browser Performance Issues: Malicious extensions can consume excessive system space, leading to slow browser performance, crashes, or unresponsive behavior.
5. Unauthorized Access:Some extensions request excessive permissions that allow them to access all data on websites visited by the user. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and compromise user privacy.
6. Phishing Attacks: Malicious extensions can create fake login pages that resemble legitimate sites, tricking users into entering their credentials.
